This is my first time creating web page using Vue so I research and explore first.
1.) Installation of requirements (NPM, Node, Vue)
2.) Create the name of the prject basically it will create a folder and subfolder like assests, components, and other files.
3.) Installing bootsrap
4.) Copy all the media to assets folder
5.) Start the code by editing the App.vue, place the header image and centered the text 'Hello Developer!'
6.) Create the first section for cards, then create a new file in components for cards or products content.
7.) Import and export everything in App.vue file and make some styles.
8.) Create a read more button and close button then apply accordion in every cards.
8.) When everything is good in laptop and pc, I create the styles for mobile and tablet.
9.) Test everything and apply some transition and effects.
10.) Send the project. Fork a repo in Github.

Explanation
The result of ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana is because "+ + a" is like "a '+a'"  and it's a NaN or Not a Number and other caracther is not number and to lowercase it becomes banana.


### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
